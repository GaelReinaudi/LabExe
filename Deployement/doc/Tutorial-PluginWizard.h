\section InstallProject Install the wizard

Be sure to have complied with the pre-requisite installation so that you can compile the source code. 
\see \ref PreRequisiteInstallation

This installs a shortcut to the wizard on the desktop and in the start menu \e LabExe.

\section RunWizard Run the wizard

When starting the wizard, you will be prompted to enter a name for the new soft device that 
you want to make. A good naming scheme would look like this:
- LowPassFilter
- RandomNumberGenerator
- NumberStepper


As of today, the wizard will duplicate the <em>Low-Pass Filter Plugin</em> and rename its interanl componenents in 
a way that matches the name you choose for the new plugin.

Please refer to the \ref ExampleProject-LowPassFilterPlugin in order to know what are the 
basic componenets in the project.
